## Use Case 3: Online Banking - Wire Transfer Fraud & Money Laundering Detection

### Scenario
A retail bank's customer account is targeted by sophisticated fraudsters who use social engineering to initiate a large wire transfer. The system detects unusual patterns and prevents potential money laundering activity.

### End-to-End Flow

#### 1. Initial Compromise & Social Engineering
- **Actor**: Organized fraud ring targeting elderly customers
- **Victim**: 68-year-old retired customer with $85,000 checking account balance
- **Attack Vector**: Phone scam ("IRS tax fraud" threat)
- **Action**: Customer instructed to wire $25,000 to "safe government account" to avoid arrest
- **Normal Behavior**: Small monthly transfers ($500-$1,200), local bill payments, ATM withdrawals

#### 2. Wire Transfer Initiation
- Customer logs into online banking from home computer (verified device)
- Initiates international wire transfer:
  - Amount: $25,000
  - Destination: Account in Hong Kong (first international transfer ever)
  - Beneficiary: Unknown business entity "Global Trade Solutions Ltd"
  - Purpose: "Tax Payment" (unusual for international wire)
  - Transaction time: 11:47 PM (outside normal banking hours)

#### 3. Payment Gateway & Transaction Capture
- **PaymentGatewayService** receives wire transfer request via Authorize.Net banking API
- System captures comprehensive transaction data:
  - Wire amount: $25,000 (largest single transaction in 5 years)
  - Destination country: Hong Kong (high-risk jurisdiction)
  - Customer age: 68 (elderly demographic - higher fraud risk)
  - Transaction type: International wire (first ever for this account)
  - Time: 23:47 local time (unusual for this customer)
  - Device: Recognized device but unusual browser activity (rapid clicks, multiple form corrections)

#### 4. Multi-Layer Fraud Detection Analysis

    - Customer location: Verified (home IP in Texas)
    - Destination country: Hong Kong (flagged as higher-risk for elder fraud)
  - Account age analysis: 12-year customer, zero international wires
  - Time-of-day analysis: Transaction at 11:47 PM (customer typically banks 9 AM - 2 PM)
  - Session behavior: 7 failed attempts to enter routing number (sign of being instructed by phone)

**Step 4b: Machine Learning Risk Assessment**
- **OnnxModelService** runs multiple ONNX fraud models:
  - Elder fraud detection model: 0.94 score (very high probability)
  - Wire transfer fraud model: 0.88 score
  - Money laundering pattern model: 0.82 score (unusual beneficiary + high amount)
  - **EnsembleModelService** aggregates: **Final ML Score: 0.91/1.0**

**Step 4c: Advanced AI-Powered Analysis**

    - Prompt: "Analyze this banking transaction for fraud indicators"
    - Response: "HIGH RISK - Classic elder fraud pattern: Large international wire, unusual hour, tax payment claim to Hong Kong, elderly customer, first international transfer, multiple input errors suggesting phone instruction"

**Step 4d: Money Laundering & AML Checks**
- **FraudScoringService** performs AML analysis:
  - Beneficiary screening: "Global Trade Solutions Ltd" not in known contacts
  - OFAC/sanctions list check: Destination bank flagged for past money laundering concerns
  - Structuring analysis: Single large transfer just under $30K reporting threshold
  - Layering detection: Checks if beneficiary has rapid transfer patterns
  - **CosmosDbService** queries historical data: Zero prior relationship with beneficiary

**Step 4e: Rules Engine Multi-Factor Evaluation**
- **FraudRulesEngine** applies banking-specific alert rules:
  - ✅ "International wire > $10,000 from customer age 65+ with no prior international transfers"
  - ✅ "Transaction amount > 10x monthly average outbound"
  - ✅ "Wire transfer outside normal banking hours (10 PM - 6 AM)"
  - ✅ "High-risk destination country + elderly customer + tax-related purpose"
