# Global Payment Fraud Detection System - End-to-End Use Cases

## Use Case 1: E-Commerce Platform - Real-Time Credit Card Fraud Detection

### Scenario
An online electronics retailer processes thousands of transactions daily. A fraudster attempts to make a high-value purchase using a stolen credit card from a different country.

### End-to-End Flow

#### 1. Transaction Initiation
- **Actor**: Fraudster using stolen card
- **Action**: Customer attempts to purchase a $2,499 laptop with overnight shipping to a different address than the billing address
- **Payment Method**: Stripe credit card payment
- **Location**: Transaction originates from Nigeria, but card is from USA

#### 2. Payment Gateway Integration
- Transaction data flows from the e-commerce checkout to **PaymentGatewayService**
- System captures:
  - Transaction amount: $2,499
  - Shipping address: Lagos, Nigeria
  - Billing address: New York, USA
  - IP address: 102.89.xxx.xxx (Nigeria)
  - Device fingerprint
  - Customer email: newaccount@tempmail.com (created 5 minutes ago)

#### 3. Real-Time Fraud Analysis Pipeline

**Step 3a: Behavioral Analysis**
- **BehavioralAnalysisService** analyzes the transaction:
  - Detects IP geolocation mismatch (Nigeria vs USA)
  - MaxMind GeoIP2 identifies high-risk country
  - Velocity check: First transaction from new account
  - Device fingerprinting shows new, unrecognized device

**Step 3b: ML Model Scoring**
- **OnnxModelService** runs ONNX fraud detection models:
  - Card pattern analysis: Detects unusual spending pattern
  - Transaction behavior model scores: 0.87 (high risk)
  - **EnsembleModelService** combines multiple models: Final score 0.89

**Step 3c: Advanced Risk Scoring**
- **AdvancedRiskScoringService** leverages Azure AI:
  - Azure Text Analytics analyzes customer email domain (temporary email provider)
  - Azure Anomaly Detector flags unusual purchase pattern for new account
  - Azure OpenAI analyzes transaction context and flags suspicious shipping

**Step 3d: Rules Engine Evaluation**
- **FraudRulesEngine** applies configured alert rules:
  - ✅ Rule triggered: "Transaction amount > $1,000 AND new account < 24 hours"
  - ✅ Rule triggered: "Billing/Shipping country mismatch"
  - ✅ Rule triggered: "High-risk country + high-value purchase"

#### 4. Fraud Scoring & Decision
- **FraudScoringService** aggregates all signals:
  - Combined fraud score: **92/100 (CRITICAL)**
  - Risk level: **CRITICAL**
  - Recommendation: **DECLINE**

#### 5. Alert Generation & Notification
- System publishes alert to **Azure Service Bus** queue
- **ServiceBusService** processes the alert
- **NotificationService** triggers:
  - Email alert sent to fraud team
  - SMS alert via Twilio to on-call fraud analyst
  - Webhook notification to e-commerce platform API

#### 6. Real-Time Dashboard Update
- **Azure Service Bus Trigger** (ProcessFraudAlert function) processes the alert
- **SignalRHub** broadcasts real-time update to dashboard
- Fraud analyst sees alert appear instantly on **Fraud Detection Dashboard**:
  - Red critical alert card appears
  - Transaction details displayed
  - Recommended action: DECLINE

#### 7. Analyst Action & Resolution
- Fraud analyst reviews alert on dashboard
- Clicks "Decline Transaction" button
- **AlertsController** API processes the action
- Transaction is declined via **PaymentGatewayService** → Stripe
- Alert status updated to "Resolved - Declined"
- Customer sees payment declined message

#### 8. Data Persistence & Analytics
- All transaction data stored in **Azure Cosmos DB** via **CosmosDbService**
- Event streamed to **Azure Event Hubs** for analytics
- **Application Insights** logs telemetry for monitoring
- **Timer Trigger** function (GenerateDailyFraudReport) includes this case in daily reports

### Outcome
- **Fraud Prevented**: $2,499 chargeback avoided
- **Detection Time**: 847ms (sub-second)
- **False Positive**: No - Confirmed fraud attempt
- **ROI**: Saved merchant $2,499 + chargeback fees (~$100) = $2,599

## Use Case 2: Digital Marketplace - Account Takeover & Payment Fraud Prevention

### Scenario
A legitimate customer's account on a digital services marketplace is compromised. The attacker attempts to purchase gift cards and digital goods using saved payment methods.

### End-to-End Flow

#### 1. Account Compromise
- **Actor**: Attacker with stolen credentials
- **Action**: Logs into victim's account using phished credentials
- **Previous Behavior**: Legitimate user typically logs in from California, makes small monthly subscriptions ($9.99)
- **Attacker Behavior**: Login from Eastern Europe, attempts to buy $500 in gift cards

#### 2. Login & Session Analysis
- System detects login from new location (Romania)
- **BehavioralAnalysisService** analyzes:
  - Historical login patterns from Cosmos DB
  - Typical transaction patterns: $9.99-$29.99 monthly
  - Previous locations: Always California, USA
  - Device fingerprint: New device, different browser

#### 3. Transaction Attempt Detection
- Attacker adds $500 worth of gift cards to cart
- Selects saved PayPal payment method
- Attempts rapid checkout (3 clicks in 5 seconds - automated behavior)

#### 4. Multi-Signal Fraud Analysis

**Step 4a: Velocity & Behavioral Checks**
- **BehavioralAnalysisService** flags:
  - Location anomaly: California → Romania (6,000+ miles)
  - Purchase amount anomaly: $9.99 average → $500 spike (5000% increase)
  - Rapid checkout behavior (automated script detected)
  - Time zone mismatch: 3 AM California time (unusual for this user)

**Step 4b: ML-Based Pattern Recognition**
- **OnnxModelService** analyzes:
  - Purchase pattern deviation score: 0.91
  - Account takeover probability: 0.88
- **EnsembleModelService** combines models:
  - Gift card fraud pattern detected (common money laundering method)
  - Final ML score: 0.89 (high risk)

**Step 4c: Azure AI Enrichment**
- **AdvancedRiskScoringService** with Azure AI:
  - Azure Anomaly Detector: Flags purchase as statistically anomalous (99.7% confidence)
  - Azure OpenAI analyzes session behavior: "Typical account takeover pattern - geographic anomaly + high-value digital goods"
  - Azure AI Search finds similar historical fraud cases

**Step 4d: Historical Context**
- **CosmosDbService** queries user transaction history:
  - 24-month clean history
  - Never purchased gift cards before
  - Never logged in from Europe
  - Consistent $9.99 subscription payments

#### 5. Real-Time Decision Making
- **FraudScoringService** calculates:
  - Behavioral score: 88/100
  - ML model score: 89/100
  - Rules engine score: 95/100
  - **Final fraud score: 91/100 (CRITICAL)**

- **FraudRulesEngine** triggers:
  - ✅ "Geographic anomaly + high-value purchase"
  - ✅ "Gift card purchase > $100 from new location"
  - ✅ "Account takeover indicators present"

#### 6. Automated Response & Escalation
- System automatically **BLOCKS** transaction
- **NotificationService** triggers multi-channel alerts:
  - **Email to legitimate account owner**: "Suspicious activity detected - transaction blocked"
  - **SMS to registered phone**: "Security alert: $500 purchase blocked. Reply YES if this was you."
  - **Webhook to marketplace platform**: Account flagged for review
  - **Dashboard alert** to fraud team via **SignalRHub**

#### 7. Customer Verification Flow
- Legitimate customer receives SMS and email
- Clicks verification link → redirected to secure account review page
- Confirms: "This was NOT me"
- Forced password reset initiated
- All active sessions terminated via **Settings API**

#### 8. Fraud Team Investigation
- Fraud analyst receives real-time alert on dashboard
- Reviews complete session timeline:
  - Login from Romania (IP: 85.xxx.xxx.xxx)
  - 3 failed 2FA attempts before bypass
  - Immediate navigation to gift cards section
  - Automated checkout pattern detected

- Analyst actions:
  - Permanently blocks the Romanian IP via **RateLimitingMiddleware** configuration
  - Adds attacker's device fingerprint to blacklist
  - Creates new alert rule: "Block all gift card purchases > $100 from Eastern Europe IPs"

#### 9. Azure Functions - Scheduled Analysis
- **Timer Trigger** (HourlyAnomalyDetection) runs:
  - Detects 15 similar account takeover attempts in past hour
  - All targeting accounts with saved payment methods
  - All attempting gift card purchases

- **HTTP Trigger** (BulkAnalyze) processes batch:
  - Identifies credential stuffing attack pattern
  - Auto-generates threat intelligence report
  - Updates ML models with new attack signatures

#### 10. Continuous Learning & Prevention
